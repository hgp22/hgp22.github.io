Hello, I'm Henrique and I am currently studying [Software Engineering](https://web.di.uminho.pt/sitedi/enginf/) @ [Universidade do Minho](https://www.uminho.pt/PT).

I am an active member of the Software Engineering Students Association, [CeSIUM](https://www.uminho.pt/PT) for short, creating new projects and generating new ideias to help all students enrolled in our course. One of our biggest projects is, an open, non-profit, free movement, [CoderDojo Braga](https://coderdojobraga.org/), that teaches programming to children and teenagers from ages 7 to 17.

I studied music and transverse flute for 12 years, and I am currently practicing Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.
